content_title: Tiger Cloud
content_team: Personal Work / Brand Design, April 2016
content_question: How to combine the brand's meaning with the major service together? 
content_explain: Tiger Cloud is a SaaS services provider as well as a newly start-up information company. My responsibility was to design the logo for its website, which should convey the sense of science and technology. The first inspiration was from the power of the tiger's fist, then I found a way to present its character in data transmission.
